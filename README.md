# Simple
A programming language that uses commands in simple english.

Extremely WIP. [(I also need a new name.)](https://bit.ly/new-language-name-needed)

#### Plans (in no particular order)
- If/While ("while this condition has not been met")
- Game scenes ("Create a window with a width of x and a height of y")
- Events ("When this key is pressed..." "When sprite is clicked")
- Sprites and sprite movement. ("Create a sprite, sprite, at x, y" "Set the texture of sprite to texture" "Move sprite to x,y")
- Characters (one-letter strings, almost implemented.)
- Arrays
