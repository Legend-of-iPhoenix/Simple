# Simple
A programming language that uses commands in simple english.

Extremely WIP.

#### Plans (in no particular order)
- If/Until/While (until is the opposite of while, like "Until this condition is met" instead of "while this condition has not been met")
- Game scenes ("Create a window with a width of x and a height of y")
- Events ("When this key is pressed..." "When sprite is clicked")
- Sprites and sprite movement. ("Create a sprite, sprite, at x, y" "Set the texture of sprite to texture" "Move sprite to x,y"
- Strings and characters
- Arrays
